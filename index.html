<h1>Hello</h1>
<p>Welcome to my adventures in web development</p>
<p>
	Here I'll be keeping track of what I'm up to as well as any interesting things
	I come across. The tech I'm interested in right now are:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>HTML</li>
	<li>CSS</li>
	<li>Javascript</li>
	<li>PHP</li>
	<li>Jekyll</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The first three for obvious reasons, being the building blocks of the web.
	PHP, to use with the Wordpress\Laravel framework and Jekyll because this site
	is built on that stack and I'm enjoying it.
